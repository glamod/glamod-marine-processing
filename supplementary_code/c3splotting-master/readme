---------------------
setup
---------------------
runs in R, only package required is "config"

module load jasr

open a R session (type R at the command line) then
install.packages("config")

you'll need to select a mirror site to download from, maybe in a
pop-up window, then quit

q()
n

---------------------
change config
---------------------
look at config_level0.yml & config_level2.yml to see where files are read from
and written to edit if required

---------------------
test
---------------------

try running using a selected deck, e.g. 749

Rscript do_level0.R 749 749
Rscript do_level2.R 749 749

---------------------
submit via slurm
---------------------

for level0 edit the file sublev0ind.slurm so that one of the groups (or part
of one of the groups) is selected (single # before sbatch)

then:

sbatch sublev0ind.slurm

and see what is happening: https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4892-how-to-monitor-slurm-jobs

for level2 jobs are in 2 files:
dosub2small.slurm
dosub2big.slurm
